# Workshop Template

This is a template repository for the Claude Code workshop. It contains the scaffolding and slash commands needed to build a full-stack application with Claude Code.

## What's Included

- **`.claude/commands/`** - Slash commands for planning, execution, validation, and workflow automation
- **`.claude/reference/`** - Best practices documentation for various technologies
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Template for project-specific instructions (fill this in as you build)

## Getting Started

1. **Fork or clone** this repository
2. **Define your project** — Have a conversation with your AI coding assistant about what you want to build. Discuss requirements, features, and technical decisions.
3. **Create your PRD** — Run `/create-prd` to generate a Product Requirements Document based on your conversation
4. **Build your CLAUDE.md** — Work with the AI assistant to fill in the `CLAUDE.md` template with your project's tech stack, structure, conventions, and commands
5. **Create reference documents** — Add detailed guides to `.claude/reference/` for specific parts of your codebase (e.g., API patterns, database conventions, deployment strategies). Keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and point to these references when needed — this prevents overwhelming the LLM with context while still giving detailed guidance when working on specific areas.
6. **Start building** — Use the development workflow:
   - `/core_piv_loop:prime` — Load project context
   - `/core_piv_loop:plan-feature` — Create an implementation plan for a feature
   - `/core_piv_loop:execute` — Execute the plan step-by-step

   These commands follow the **PIV Loop** (Prime → Implement → Validate) workflow:
